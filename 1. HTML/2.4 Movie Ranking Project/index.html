 <h3>Meet the Robinsons</h3>
 <p>
    Growing up, I've been doing lots of mistakes, this movie<br />
    have helped me to understand that it is okay to do mistakes<br />
    because through them, you'll learn. Just "keep moving forward",<br />
    it doesn't matter how many times you do it. Just keep moving forward.

 <h3>Inception</h3>
 <p>
    The story line + the cinematography was a chef's kiss. I don't want<br />
    to spoil everyone, but to those who hasn't watched it yet, you should<br />
    definitely check this one out!

 <h3>Encanto</h3>
 <p>
    I'm really a fan of animated movies/series, and this movie is also<br /> 
    one of them. It's fun, and has very relatable characters.
